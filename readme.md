## **Problem Statement**

### **Financial Risk Assessment Challenges**

Modern financial institutions face critical challenges in accurately assessing and managing portfolio risks across diverse asset classes. Traditional risk assessment methodologies often fail to capture the complex, dynamic nature of financial markets and credit portfolios, leading to:

**Credit Risk Assessment Gaps:**

- Inadequate default probability modeling using static statistical approaches
- Limited integration of behavioral patterns and utilization trends
- Insufficient correlation modeling between individual credit exposures
- Lack of real-time risk calculation capabilities for large portfolios

**Market Risk Assessment Limitations:**

- Over-reliance on historical data without predictive modeling
- Inadequate capture of volatility clustering and market regime changes
- Limited Monte Carlo simulation capabilities due to computational constraints
- Insufficient integration of AI/ML models with traditional risk metrics

**Computational Performance Issues:**

- Slow risk calculation processing for large-scale portfolios
- Limited parallel processing capabilities for Monte Carlo simulations
- Inadequate real-time dashboard and visualization systems
- Scalability constraints for million-iteration simulation requirements

### **Solution Approach**

This project develops **dual AI-enhanced Monte Carlo simulation pipelines** that integrate advanced machine learning models with high-performance computing to deliver comprehensive, real-time financial risk assessment capabilities. The solution addresses both credit default risk and market volatility risk through sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques.
